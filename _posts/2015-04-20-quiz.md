    var x = 30;
    return this.x;

var o = {
        x: 8,

        valueOf: function(){
            return this.x + 2;
        },
        toString: function(){
            return this.x.toString();
        }
    },
    result = o < "9";

alert(o);
```
The valueOf() method is called whenever comparisons are done and toString() is called whenever automatic conversion into a string is necessary. By overriding these methods, you can control the values they return in various circumstances.

```
function f(x, y) {
  x = 10;
  console.log(
    arguments[0],
    arguments[1]
  );
}

f();
```
A named argument is no more special than a local variable, and so changing its value doesn’t affect the arguments object

```
var
  b = 10,
  c = (
    20,
    function (x) { return x + 100},
    function () { return arguments[0]}
  );

a = b + c
({x: 10}).x
```
There are only two concepts that you need to understand to answer this. The first is how the comma operator works, which you should be an expert in by now. The value of c is the function function(){ return arguments[0];}, which just returns the first argument that was passed in.

The second thing you need to know is how automatic semicolon insertion works. Because of the way the code is formatted, you might be inclined to believe that a semicolon will be inserted after a = b + c. Keep in mind that c is a function, and the next non-whitespace character is (. In this case, the whitespace is ignored, so the last line is actually:

a = b + c({x: 10}).x
Since the function contained in c simply passes back the argument that was passed in, the result of this expression is logically equivalent to:

a = b + ({x: 10}).x
And that is really just:

a = b + 10
This makes a equal to 20, and that is the final value of the code.


```

```
Function.prototype.toString.call({
    name: 'F', 
    body: 'print("Javascript is hard")'
});
```

```
new String({
    toString : function (){ return this;}, 
    valueOf : function () {return this;}
});
```

```
typeof (new Date() + new Date());

```

```
function F() {}
F.prototype = new Function;
Object.prototype.toString.call(new F());
```
```
[].length = -2;

```
简单来说js的数组要求length 的范围在0 - 2的32次方-1 之间.
那么对于 [].length = xxx 这本质是以'length'为参数,调用数组对象自身的 [PUT]方法, 并把xxx作为value. 这是个过程中会调用
ToUint32(xxx) 然后再去与 ToNumber(xxx) 的结果做对比.如果不相等.则抛出RangeError. 内部运算 ToUint32 是不会返回负数的.所以与ToNumber的结果一定不同. so ...
