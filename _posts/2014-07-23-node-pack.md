###lodash

Despite the fact that Node.js has great built-in utilities, we find that the brevity and utility of lodash helps maintainability. We switched from underscore.js to lodash after discovering some very hot code in our realtime back-end, and got a significant performance win. We never looked back. Since we also use lodash client-side (it's highly portable), it lets us use great functional-programming paradigms like _.map without having to worry about if Array#map() is present! Also, the lodash documentation is excellent--awesomeness we hope to emulate in our own docs.
